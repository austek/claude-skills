# Use StructuredTaskScope for Fan-Out/Fan-In Tasks [MEDIUM]

## Description
`StructuredTaskScope` treats a group of concurrent subtasks as a single unit of work: they are forked from one scope, and the scope does not exit until every subtask completes, fails, or is cancelled together. This closes the gap that hand-rolled `Future`/`ExecutorService` fan-out leaves open — a sibling task that keeps running after another one fails, or a thread leaked past the method that started it. A `Joiner` policy on the scope (e.g., "fail fast if any subtask fails," "succeed as soon as one does") governs that propagation declaratively instead of via manual bookkeeping.

**Preview status**: StructuredTaskScope is not a stable API. It shipped as a preview feature in Java 21 (JEP 453) and has been revised in every subsequent preview (JEP 462, JEP 480, JEP 499 as of Java 24) — the shape below reflects the JEP 499-era `open()`/`Joiner` API, which differs from the `ShutdownOnFailure`/`ShutdownOnSuccess` subclasses of the original JEP 453 preview. It requires `--enable-preview` to compile and run. Check your target JDK's release notes before depending on it in production, and expect the API to still be in motion.

## Bad Example
```java
ExecutorService pool = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor();
Future<User> userFuture = pool.submit(() -> fetchUser(id));
Future<List<Order>> ordersFuture = pool.submit(() -> fetchOrders(id));
// If fetchOrders fails, fetchUser keeps running unmanaged — no shared cancellation,
// and a thrown exception here leaks both threads past this method.
User user = userFuture.get();
List<Order> orders = ordersFuture.get();
```

## Good Example
```java
try (var scope = StructuredTaskScope.open(Joiner.<Object>awaitAllSuccessfulOrThrow())) {
    Subtask<User> user = scope.fork(() -> fetchUser(id));
    Subtask<List<Order>> orders = scope.fork(() -> fetchOrders(id));
    scope.join(); // waits for both; cancels the sibling if either fails
    return new Profile(user.get(), orders.get());
} // scope guarantees no subtask outlives this block
```

## Notes
- A subtask can only be observed (`Subtask.get()`) after `scope.join()` returns successfully — reading it earlier is a programming error the API rejects.
- Use this for fan-out over independent, related subtasks (parallel lookups composing one result); a single async call needs no scope.
- Pair with virtual threads (`concurrency-virtual-threads`) — the model assumes forking many cheap, blocking subtasks.
